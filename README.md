# GIS-based-on-the-R-language
This is a learning example for processing spatial data using the R language.
In this repository, I will introduce the Rmd code used in the CASA0005 course, involving spatiotemporal analysis based on .csv and .shp data. In two case studies, I applied various spatial analysis methods, including DBSCAN and Moran's I, achieving the linkage and visualization of tabular and geographic data. As CASA0005 emphasizes the requirement to focus on research questions/significance, a significant portion of the content will be dedicated to introducing the data and discussing the research significance.
